# the two RHEL hosts with deliberately vulnerable packages, and
# pre-populates the two playbooks Module 3's Steps 1 and 2 walk the

# Those playbooks ship alongside this script as real files, in
# setup-automation/files-satellite/, copied here by
# setup-automation/main.yml. This script has no `set -e`, so a missing
# payload would fail silently and Module 3 would hand the participant a
# nonexistent playbook. Fail up front instead, before anything on this
# host has been touched.
