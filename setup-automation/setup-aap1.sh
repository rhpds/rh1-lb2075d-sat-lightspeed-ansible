# This script runs as root on aap1 (via setup-automation/main.yml). AAP
# itself, and the aap1-user OS account, are already baked into the
# aap1-* golden image - this script wires up the Satellite -> EDA
# webhook pipeline (self-hosted rulebook repo, EDA credentials,
# Project, Event Stream, Activation), the registry.redhat.io pre-auth
# and vulnerability-remediation repo Module 4 needs, and the playbooks
# Module 3's Step 3 and Module 4's Steps 2/3/4 walk the participant
# through running.
# Idempotent: every step here is safe to run again on every
# (re)provision.
#
# See docs/EDA_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md for the full manual/CLI walkthrough this
# script automates, including troubleshooting notes.

# The bulk of the work ships alongside this script as real files, in
# setup-automation/files-aap1/, copied here by setup-automation/main.yml:
# the whole aap1-user half of setup (setup-as-aap1-user.sh), the
# vulnerability finder, the remediation playbook, the Containerfile,
# Module 3's verify playbook, Module 4's three /root playbooks, and the
# EDA rulebook the third of them publishes.
#
# This script has no `set -e`, so a missing payload would fail silently
# and we would go on to git-commit and push a repo with files missing.
# Module 4 would then hand the participant a broken
# ~/vulnerability-remediation. Fail up front, before anything on this
# host has been touched.

# Pre-authenticate root's podman against registry.redhat.io so Module 4
# (Step 2, building the custom Execution Environment) never has to ask
# the participant for their own Red Hat registry credentials by hand.
# REGISTRY_PULL_TOKEN is the full base64 "auth" value from a registry
# service account (username and password already combined), passed
# through by setup-automation/main.yml.
#
# Write the credential directly to root's DEFAULT podman auth file
# ($HOME/.config/containers/auth.json, i.e. /root/.config/containers/
# auth.json - this is what podman falls back to when $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
# isn't set, which is the common case for a non-interactive root shell).
# An earlier version of this wrote to a /tmp file, pointed `podman
# login --authfile` at that SAME /tmp file, then deleted it - so the
# credential never reached podman's real default location at all and
# every later `podman build`/`pull` as root still prompted for auth.
# Also set REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE in /root/.bashrc as a second, explicit
# guarantee that works even if some other login shell's $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
# happens to be set and would otherwise take precedence.
# Declare aap1.lab itself as an insecure registry (HTTPS with
# certificate verification skipped) in registries.conf.d, rather than
# relying solely on the one-off `podman push/build --tls-verify=false`
# CLI flag. Without this, some internal podman operations (e.g. the
# cross-repository blob-reuse ping that happens on push) don't reliably
# honor that per-command flag and fall back to plain HTTP on port 80
# instead, which nothing listens on ("connect: connection refused"),
# even though the actual registry (served over HTTPS on 443 by envoy)
# works fine.

# Pre-populate the three playbooks Module 4 (Steps 2, 3 and 4) walks the
