# This module genuinely spans three hosts (rhel1.lab, satellite.lab,
# aap1.lab) with a STRICT ORDER that matters: check rhel1+rhel2 ->
# trigger on satellite -> poll aap1 -> check rhel1+rhel2 again.
# runtime-automation/main.yml runs every host's solve-{host}.sh for a
# module in parallel (there's no built-in cross-host sequencing), so
# splitting this into separate solve-rhel1.sh/solve-rhel2.sh/
# solve-satellite.sh/solve-aap1.sh files would NOT preserve that
# ordering - they'd all fire at once, and rhel1/rhel2's "before" checks
# could easily run after the job already remediated them. Keeping the
# whole sequence in one script (hopping to the other hosts via ssh) is
# intentional here, unlike Module 4 (which has no such ordering
# dependency and is correctly a single native solve-aap1.sh instead).
#
# Step 1: check the deliberately-vulnerable package versions on BOTH
# hosts before triggering anything. Checking only rhel1.lab would miss
# the entire point of this module - the webhook fires from rhel1.lab,
# but remediation is fleet-wide, so rhel2.lab (which never fires a
# webhook of its own) has to be checked too.
