# only makes sense on satellite.lab, so solve-satellite.sh is correct

# Steps 1 and 2 of module-03.adoc (the custom JSON webhook template, and
# the webhook pointing at aap1's EDA Event Stream) are exactly what
# these two playbooks do - setup-automation/setup-satellite.sh already
# pre-populated them under /root (self-contained and idempotent), so
# re-run them here rather than duplicating the same API logic a second
# time in this file.
#
# create-webhook.yml is also where this module's two cross-host lookups
# live: the Basic Auth secret file and the Event Stream's current URL,
# both read from aap1.lab. satellite.lab needs them to build its own
# webhook, and there's no shared filesystem between hosts to pass that
# data any other way.

# here (it checks EDA's own localhost API), so this is an SSH hop, same
# as the two read-only lookups create-webhook.yml itself makes. It is
# read-only, so re-running it here does nothing but check.
